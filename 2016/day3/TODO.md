I have to find the count of valid triangles

How to find which is valide triangle

if the sides of triangle are 5 10 25
sum of any two sides must be larger than third side so, here 5 + 10 < 25
so, it is not a valid triangle.

how I am goint to do this is
I will take array of three sides and I will sort it and I will add first two elements and checkwith the last element .
